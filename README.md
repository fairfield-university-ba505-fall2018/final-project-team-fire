# BA505 Final Project
## Team Fire


## Introduction 
For our final project we decided to look at Fire Incident data for Connecticut in 2014.  We found this information from the following source: https://data.ct.gov/Public-Safety/Connecticut-Fire-Department-Incidents-2014/axrk-twst . The dataset was too large to push to Github. Therefore, we considered which sampling method would be best to reduce the size of our data. We utilized stratified sampling to select towns within Fairfield County to obtain a sample population that best represents the entire population being studied. The selected towns were: Fairfield, Greenwich, Norwalk, Stamford, Westport, Darien, Noroton Heights, Noroton, Rowayton.


## Data Analysis Tools
We used the standard imports as well as the Scikit Learn regression tool.
